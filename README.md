# MSSQL-server
Creating a repo for MSSQL solutions and guide to installation

I am using MacOS, so installation of SQL-server has to be done by running docker container. I have to tried to jot down the necessary steps to successfully run SQL-server docker container and start accessing the server through Azure Data Studio and RazorSQL.
